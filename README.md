# Arknoid

An implementation of the classic Arkanoid brick breaker game using Java. It was done part of the OOP course I took during in the 2nd year of my bachelor degree. Arkanoid is a classic brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to deflect a ball against a wall of bricks. The goal of the game is to clear all of the bricks by breaking them. The player can lose the game by letting the ball fall below the bottom of the screen.

## Information
The game contains a gui friendly platform.
It was written in Java language using Intellij IDEA Ultimate IDE, using the following OOP principals:

- Polymorphism and inheritance.
- Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.
- Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.
- Working with GUI.
